### Assignment Process

I have created a multiple page website based on the HTML/CSS templates provided in class.
It is an art portfolio, using an interactive drawboard as the "hero image".

I have used fixed width styling, but also included other styling methods to make the creative navigation more accessible in smaller screens.

I think the minimum amount of pages was 3, but I have 6 - although, 1 includes an under construction page, and a defunct submit form. (I don't know PHP)

I have created a repository for the FIP, and used workflow practices outlined in class

I have created a website, and used UX/UI enhancements of my choice using CSS best practices as demonstrated
in class. 

I have used various stylings of virtual content associated with in-class (and out of class) coding. 

I have created the github and readme file, and now submitting to all classes.
