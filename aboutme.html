                <h1>Once upon a time, a creative understood his path.</h1><br>
                
                This creative was comfortably ingrained in the independent music community. <br><br>
                His name is David Gonzales, although his intended name was Ramon.<br><br>
                <h2>One day, David quit making music due to mental illness.</h2><br>
                He lost all his momentum; and for many moons, he wallowed in an identity-based confusion which stagnated his creativity.<br><br> 
                He attempted to break free from those chains by engaging in multiple creative projects over the years, turning him into a creative nomad with no home to base himself from.<br><br>
                The outcome of his works seeming as if he is trying to communicate through a language he does not understand. <br>
                This only frustrated him, and contributed to his overwhelming feeling of constant block. <br>
                A creative by heart, he knows nothing else but to create.<br><br><br><br>

            <div class = "aboutme-image" >
    
                <h2 class = "hidden" >About Me Image</h2><!-- Image used in About Me-->
                <img src = "images/aboutmeimage.png" alt = "Image of the Website Creator" id = "aboutmeimage" >

                <h2 class = "hidden" >About Me Part 2</h2>
                <h2>With no means to create, all he wanted to do is scream to the void - but, it was as if he had no mouth.</h2><br>
                He started violently scribbling; and kept going until the pen was piercing through, voraciously gutting the canvas he carefully set-up in calmer times.<br>
                A feeling he felt once again while making this horrible excuse of an art portfolio.<br><br>
                <h2>Thus, in the fires of uninspiration, the idea of the Chaos Canvas was born:</h2><br>
                An idea so obviously staring him in the face as he was scribbling away, wondering what he should do for his project.
                The Chaos Canvas is a means to scribble to his hearts content, and digitally store creative projects.<br><br>
                A way to sow order in the chaos, so to speak.<br><br>
                After all, an artist's greatest flaw - and asset - is their disordered mind. <br>
                To quell the chaos is to lose the passion, but to maintain no order is to lose sense of self.<br>
